Created a hypothetical visualization model out of driver/client data for a potential startup company to compete with the likes of Uber. 

Built a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


Created three pie charts displaying the following three:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type
